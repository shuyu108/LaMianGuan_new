<h3>So What is "LaMian Guan"?</h3>
<p>"LaMian Guan" means literally: A Restaurant that sells LaMian. </p>
<p class="text-justify">The Chinese "LaMian（拉面）" is the origin of the well-known Ramen, which is a Japanese version of it(both in terms of linguistics and the food). To non-asian people, LaMian and Ramen are both noodles broth. Even many asian people are not aware of the difference between the two. But if I present you the following table, you will find that they are indeed very different beasts:  </p>

<p class="text-justify">LaMian is always my favorite food. It's simple, cheap, and delicious. The clear beef broth is magical. Hours of slowly brewing with Ox bones give it a rich flavor. Such a broth does not require soy sauce or spices to decorate. Only chili oil and venegar is provided at side. </p>
<p class="text-justify">The better thing is, no two bowls of LaMian will be the same. Sometimes a few of the "knobs" Hand-stretched Noodles will be presented, which is basically a small dough ball at the end of noodles. Sometimes the beef broth can be under-brewed, so that the soup is less tasteful as it should. For most times, the changes are more subtle and delicate; but even in these worse occasions, the noodles being presented is still enjoyable. These unpreditable variations make people never tired of having LaMian. In fact, because of the flavor and affodability, many Chinese people show up at LaMian-Guans everyday.  </p>
